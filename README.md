AutoPitch 🎯

AI-Powered Portfolio Pitching System

AutoPitch is an intelligent solution built to automate how service-based startups, freelancers, and tech teams pitch their portfolios to clients based on selected tech stacks. Instead of manually curating project links, AutoPitch uses a vector database and LLMs to dynamically recommend and serve the most relevant portfolios—instantly.

💡 Why AutoPitch?

In tech services, clients often ask:

“Do you have experience with React + MongoDB?”
“Can you show work with Python and Django?”

Manually responding to each inquiry is repetitive and time-consuming. AutoPitch solves this with an automated, intelligent system that delivers personalized portfolios in seconds—based on client input.
